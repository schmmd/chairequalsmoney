<P>The rules to Chair Equals Money are similar to those of Sokoban. The man <IMG SRC="man.bmp"> can walk either North, West, South, or East. He <IMG SRC="man.bmp"> is controlled by the four arrow keys. In addition to walking, he <IMG SRC="man.bmp"> can also push a single chair <IMG SRC="chair.bmp">, but he <IMG SRC="man.bmp"> may neither pull a chair <IMG SRC="chair.bmp"> nor push two chairs <IMG SRC="chair.bmp"><IMG SRC="chair.bmp"> at once. If a chair <IMG SRC="chair.bmp"> is pushed onto a base <IMG SRC="spot.bmp">, it turns to money <IMG SRC="money.bmp">. If money <IMG SRC="money.bmp"> is pushed off of a base <IMG SRC="spot.bmp">, it reverts to a chair <IMG SRC="chair.bmp">. The objective is to turn all of the chairs <IMG SRC="chair.bmp"> into money <IMG SRC="money.bmp">. </P>
